Support Recovery on fMRI Data
=============================

This example compares methods based on Desparsified Lasso (DL) to estimate
voxel activation maps associated with behavior, specifically decoder map support.
All methods presented here provide statistical guarantees.

To demonstrate these methods, we use the Haxby dataset, focusing on the
'face vs house' contrast. We analyze labeled activation maps from a single subject
to produce a brain map showing the discriminative pattern between these two conditions.

This example illustrates that in high-dimensional settings (many voxels),
DL becomes impractical due to memory constraints. However, we can overcome
this limitation using feature aggregation methods that leverage the spatial structure
of the data (high correlation between neighboring voxels).

We introduce two feature aggregation methods that maintain statistical guarantees,
though with a small spatial tolerance in support detection (i.e., they may identify
null covariates "close" to non-null covariates):

* Clustered Desparsified Lasso (CLuDL): combines clustering (parcellation)
    with statistical inference
* Ensemble Clustered Desparsified Lasso (EnCluDL): adds randomization
    to the clustering process

EnCluDL is particularly powerful as it doesn't rely on a single clustering choice.
As demonstrated in :footcite:t:`chevalier2021decoding`, it produces relevant
predictive regions across various tasks.

# Analysis of the results
# -----------------------
# As advocated in introduction, the methods that do not reduce the original
# problem are not satisfying since they are too conservative.
# Among those methods, the only one that makes discoveries is the one that
# threshold the SVR decoder using a parametric approximation.
# However this method has no statistical guarantees and we can see that some
# isolated voxels are discovered, which seems quite spurious.
# The discriminative pattern derived from the clustered inference algorithm
# (CluDL) show that the method is less conservative.
# However, some reasonable patterns are also included in this solution.
# Finally, the solution provided by the ensemble clustered inference algorithm
# (EnCluDL) seems realistic as we recover the visual cortex and do not make
# spurious discoveries.
