"""
Controlled multiple variable selection on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset
=============================================================================

In this example, we explore the basics of variable selection and illustrate the need to
statistically control the amount of faslely selected variables. We compare two variable
selection methods: the Lasso and the Model-X Knockoffs :footcite:t:`candes2018panning`.
We show how the Lasso is not robust to the presence of irrelevant variables, while the
Knockoffs (KO) method is able to address this issue.

# We can clearly see that the knockoffs procedure is more conservative than the Lasso
# and rejects the spurious features while many of them are selected by the Lasso. It is
# also interesting to note that some of the selected variables (with the high KO
# statistic (e.g., worst radius, worst area, mean concave points) are also variables
# with the largest Lasso coefficients.
