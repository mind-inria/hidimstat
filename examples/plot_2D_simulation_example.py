Support recovery on simulated data (2D)
=======================================

This example shows the advantages of spatially relaxed inference when
dealing with high-dimensional spatial data. To do so, we compare several
statistical methods that aim at recovering the support, i.e., predictive
features. Among those methods some leverage the spatial structure of the
data. For more details about the inference algorithms presented in this
example or about the generative process used to simulate the data,
please refer to Chevalier et al. (2021) [1]_.

This example corresponds to the experiment described in details in
Chevalier et al. (2021) [1]_. Shortly, to simulate the data, we draw
``n_samples`` i.i.d Gaussian vectors of size ``n_features`` and reshape them
into squares (edges are equal to ``n_features ** (1/2)``). Then, to introduce
some spatial structure, we apply a Gaussian filter that correlates features
that are nearby. The 2D data are then flattened into a design matrix ``X`` to
represent it as a regression setting and to ease the computation of the
simulated target ``y`` (see below). Then, we construct the weight map ``w``
which has the same shape as the 2D data, as it contains four predictive
regions in every corner of the square. Similarly as for the construction
of ``X``, the map ``w`` is finally flattened into a vector ``beta``. Lastly,
to derive the target ``y``, we draw a white Gaussian noise ``epsilon`` and
use a linear generative model: ``y = X beta + epsilon``.

The results of this experiment show that the methods that leverage the spatial
structure of the data are relevant. More precisely, we show that clustered
inference algorithms (e.g., CluDL) and ensembled clustered inference algorithms
(e.g., EnCluDL) are more powerful than the standard inference methods (see also
Chevalier et al. (2021) [1]_). Indeed, when the number of features is much
greater than the number of samples, standard statistical methods are
unlikely to recover the support. Then, the idea of clustered inference is to
compress the data without breaking the spatial structure, leading to a
compressed problem  close to the original problem. This results in a more
powerful spatially relaxed inference. Indeed, thanks to the dimension reduction
the support recovery is feasible. However, due to the spatial compression,
there is a limited (and quantifiable) spatial uncertainty concerning the shape
of the estimated support. Finally, by considering several choices of
spatial compression, ensembled clustered inference algorithms reduce
significantly the spatial uncertainty compared to clustered inference
algorithms which consider only one spatial compression.

# Choosing inference parameters
# -----------------------------
#
# The choice of the number of clusters depends on several parameters, such as:
# the structure of the data (a higher correlation between neighboring features
# enable a greater dimension reduction, i.e. a smaller number of clusters),
# the number of samples (small datasets require more dimension reduction) and
# the required spatial tolerance (small clusters lead to limited spatial
# uncertainty). Formally, "spatial tolerance" is defined by the largest
# distance from the true support for which the occurence of a false discovery
# is not statistically controlled (c.f. :ref:`References`).
# Theoretically, the spatial tolerance ``delta`` is equal to the largest
# cluster diameter. However this choice is conservative, notably in the case
# of ensembled clustered inference. For these algorithms, we recommend to take
# the average cluster radius. In this example, we choose ``n_clusters = 200``,
# leading to a theoretical spatial tolerance ``delta = 6``, which is still
# conservative (see Results).

# Computing z-score thresholds for support estimation

#
# Below, we translate the FWER target into z-score targets.
# To compute the z-score targets we also take into account for the multiple
# testing correction. To do so, we consider Bonferroni correction.
# For methods that do not reduce the feature space, the correction
# consists in dividing the targeted FWER target by the number of features.
# For methods that group features into clusters, the correction
# consists in dividing by the number of clusters.

# Analysis of the results
# -----------------------
# As argued in the first section of this example, standard inference methods that
# do not compress the problem dramatically lack power.
# The support estimated from CluDL provides a more reasonable solution
# since we recover the four regions. However the shape of the estimated support
# is a bit rough (as it is bound to a sub-optimal clustering).
# Finally, the solution provided by EnCluDL is more accurate since the shape
# of the estimated support is closer to the true support.
# Also, one can note that the theoretical spatial tolerance is quite
# conservative. In practice, Type-1 Error guarantees seem to hold
# for a lower spatial tolerance. This is an additional benefit of clustering
# randomization.
