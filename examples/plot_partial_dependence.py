Partial Dependence and Individual Conditional Expectation Plots
===============================================================
This example is a modified version of the the example proposed in Scikit-learn:
https://scikit-learn.org/1.7/auto_examples/inspection/plot_partial_dependence.html
Partial dependence plots show the dependence between the target function [1]_
and a set of features of interest, marginalizing over the values of all other
features (the complement features). We limit to only one feature for the
calculation of the importance because the extension of this method to multiple
features is not trivial.
Similarly, an individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot :footcite:t:`goldstein2015peeking`
shows the dependence between the target function and a feature of interest.
However, unlike partial dependence plots, which show the average effect of the
features of interest, ICE plots visualize the dependence of the prediction on a
feature for each sample separately, with one line per sample.
Only one feature of interest is supported for ICE plots.
This example shows how to obtain partial dependence and ICE plots from a
:class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` and a
:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` trained on the
bike sharing dataset. The example is inspired by :footcite:t:`molnar2025`.

Notes
-----
.. [1] For classification you can think of it as the regression score before
       the link function.

# We configured a pipeline using the preprocessor that we created specifically for the

# compromise between training time and predictive performance on a test set.
#
# Importantly, this tabular dataset has very different dynamic ranges for its
# features. Neural networks tend to be very sensitive to features with varying
# scales and forgetting to preprocess the numeric feature would lead to a very
# poor model.
#
# It would be possible to get even higher predictive performance with a larger
# neural network but the training would also be significantly more expensive.
#
# Note that it is important to check that the model is accurate enough on a
# test set before plotting the partial dependence since there would be little
# use in explaining the impact of a given feature on the prediction function of
# a model with poor predictive performance. In this regard, our MLP model works
# reasonably well.

# Analysis of the plots
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We will first look at the PDPs for the numerical features. For both models, the
# general trend of the PDP of the temperature is that the number of bike rentals is
# increasing with temperature. We can make a similar analysis but with the opposite
# trend for the humidity features. The number of bike rentals is decreasing when the
# humidity increases. Finally, we see the same trend for the wind speed feature. The
# number of bike rentals is decreasing when the wind speed is increasing for both
# models. We also observe that :class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` has much
# smoother predictions than :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.
#
# Now, we will look at the partial dependence plots for the categorical features.
#
# We observe that the spring season is the lowest bar for the season feature. With the
# weather feature, the rain category is the lowest bar. Regarding the hour feature,
# we see two peaks around the 7 am and 6 pm. These findings are in line with the
# the observations we made earlier on the dataset.
#
# However, it is worth noting that we are creating potential meaningless
# synthetic samples if features are correlated.
#
# .. _ice-vs-pdp:
#
# ICE vs. PDP
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# PDP is an average of the marginal effects of the features. We are averaging the
# response of all samples of the provided set. Thus, some effects could be hidden. In
# this regard, it is possible to plot each individual response. This representation is
# called the Individual Effect Plot (ICE). In the plot below, we plot 50 randomly
# selected ICEs for the temperature and humidity features.
