        "\n# Support recovery on simulated data (2D)\n\nThis example shows the advantages of spatially relaxed inference when\ndealing with high-dimensional spatial data. To do so, we compare several\nstatistical methods that aim at recovering the support, i.e., predictive\nfeatures. Among those methods some leverage the spatial structure of the\ndata. For more details about the inference algorithms presented in this\nexample or about the generative process used to simulate the data,\nplease refer to :footcite:t:`chevalier2022spatially`.\n\nThis example corresponds to the experiment described in details in\n:footcite:t:`chevalier2022spatially`. Shortly, to simulate the data, we draw\ninto squares (edges are equal to ``n_features ** (1/2)``). Then, to introduce\nsome spatial structure, we apply a Gaussian filter that correlates features\nthat are nearby. The 2D data are then flattened into a design matrix ``X`` to\nrepresent it as a regression setting and to ease the computation of the\nsimulated target ``y`` (see below). Then, we construct the weight map ``w``\nwhich has the same shape as the 2D data, as it contains four predictive\nregions in every corner of the square. Similarly as for the construction\nof ``X``, the map ``w`` is finally flattened into a vector ``beta``. Lastly,\nto derive the target ``y``, we draw a white Gaussian noise ``epsilon`` and\nuse a linear generative model: ``y = X beta + epsilon``.\n\nThe results of this experiment show that the methods that leverage the spatial\nstructure of the data are relevant. More precisely, we show that clustered\ninference algorithms (e.g., CluDL) and ensembled clustered inference algorithms\n(e.g., EnCluDL) are more powerful than the standard inference methods (see also\n:footcite:t:`chevalier2022spatially`). Indeed, when the number of features is much\ngreater than the number of samples, standard statistical methods are\nunlikely to recover the support. Then, the idea of clustered inference is to\ncompress the data without breaking the spatial structure, leading to a\ncompressed problem  close to the original problem. This results in a more\npowerful spatially relaxed inference. Indeed, thanks to the dimension reduction\nthe support recovery is feasible. However, due to the spatial compression,\nthere is a limited (and quantifiable) spatial uncertainty concerning the shape\nof the estimated support. Finally, by considering several choices of\nspatial compression, ensembled clustered inference algorithms reduce\nsignificantly the spatial uncertainty compared to clustered inference\nalgorithms which consider only one spatial compression.\n\n## References\n.. footbibliography::\n"
