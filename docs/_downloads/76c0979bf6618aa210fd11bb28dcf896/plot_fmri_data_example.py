Support recovery on fMRI data
=============================

This example compares several methods that estimate a decoder map support
with statistical guarantees. More precisely, we aim at thresholding the
weights of some estimated decoder maps according to the confidence we have
that they are nonzero. Here, we work with the Haxby dataset and we focus on
the 'face vs house' contrast. Thus, we consider the labeled activation maps
of a given subject and try produce a brain map that corresponds to the
discriminative pattern that makes the decoding of the two conditions.

In this example, we show that standard statistical methods (i.e., method
such as thresholding by permutation test the SVR or Ridge decoder or the
algorithm introduced by Gaonkar et al. [1]_) are not powerful when applied on
the uncompressed problem (i.e., the orignal problem in which the activation
maps are not reduced using compression techniques such as parcellation).
This is notably due to the high dimensionality (too many voxels) and
structure of the data (too much correlation between neighboring voxels).
We also present two methods that offer statistical guarantees but
with a (small) spatial tolerance on the shape of the support:
clustered desparsified lasso (CLuDL) combines clustering (parcellation)
and statistical inference ; ensemble of clustered desparsified lasso (EnCluDL)
adds a randomization step over the choice of clustering.

EnCluDL is powerful and does not depend on a unique clustering choice.
As shown in Chevalier et al. (2021) [2]_, for several tasks the estimated
support (predictive regions) looks relevant.

# Analysis of the results
# -----------------------
# As advocated in introduction, the methods that do not reduce the original
# problem are not satisfying since they are too conservative.
# Among those methods, the only one that makes discoveries is the one that
# threshold the SVR decoder using a parametric approximation.
# However this method has no statistical guarantees and we can see that some
# isolated voxels are discovered, which seems quite spurious.
# The discriminative pattern derived from the clustered inference algorithm
# (CluDL) show that the method is less conservative.
# However, some reasonable paterns are also included in this solution.
# Finally, the solution provided by the ensemble clustered inference algorithm
# (EnCluDL) seems realistic as we recover the visual cortex and do not make
# spurious discoveries.
