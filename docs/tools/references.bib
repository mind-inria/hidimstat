  abstract = 	 {We develop an extension of the knockoff inference procedure, introduced by Barber &amp; Candes (2015). This new method, called Aggregation of Multiple Knockoffs (AKO), addresses the instability inherent to the random nature of knockoff-based inference. Specifically, AKO improves both the stability and power compared with the original knockoff algorithm while still maintaining guarantees for false discovery rate control. We provide a new inference procedure, prove its core properties, and demonstrate its benefits in a set of experiments on synthetic and real datasets.}

    abstract = "{Model-X knockoffs is a flexible wrapper method for high-dimensional regression algorithms, which provides guaranteed control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Due to the randomness inherent to the method, different runs of model-X knockoffs on the same dataset often result in different sets of selected variables, which is undesirable in practice. In this article, we introduce a methodology for derandomising model-X knockoffs with provable FDR control. The key insight of our proposed method lies in the discovery that the knockoffs procedure is in essence an e-BH procedure. We make use of this connection and derandomise model-X knockoffs by aggregating the e-values resulting from multiple knockoff realisations. We prove that the derandomised procedure controls the FDR at the desired level, without any additional conditions (in contrast, previously proposed methods for derandomisation are not able to guarantee FDR control). The proposed method is evaluated with numerical experiments, where we find that the derandomised procedure achieves comparable power and dramatically decreased selection variability when compared with model-X knockoffs.}",

    abstract = "{ Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a non-linear fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modelling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to control the fraction of false discoveries effectively even in high dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general high dimensional non-linear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of ‘model-X’ knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure that was originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with n⩾p, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires that the covariates are random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown or estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality but, in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case–control study of Crohn's disease in the UK, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.}",

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {Study of human disease remains challenging due to convoluted disease etiologies and complex molecular mechanisms at genetic, genomic, and proteomic levels. Many machine learning-based methods have been developed and widely used to alleviate some analytic challenges in complex human disease studies. While enjoying the modeling flexibility and robustness, these model frameworks suffer from non-transparency and difficulty in interpreting each individual feature due to their sophisticated algorithms. However, identifying important biomarkers is a critical pursuit towards assisting researchers to establish novel hypotheses regarding prevention, diagnosis and treatment of complex human diseases. Herein, we propose a Permutation-based Feature Importance Test (PermFIT) for estimating and testing the feature importance, and for assisting interpretation of individual feature in complex frameworks, including deep neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. PermFIT (available at https://github.com/SkadiEye/deepTL) is implemented in a computationally efficient manner, without model refitting. We conduct extensive numerical studies under various scenarios, and show that PermFIT not only yields valid statistical inference, but also improves the prediction accuracy of machine learning models. With the application to the Cancer Genome Atlas kidney tumor data and the HITChip atlas data, PermFIT demonstrates its practical usage in identifying important biomarkers and boosting model prediction performance.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of conditional independence testing: given a response Y and covariates (X,Z), we test the null hypothesis that Y is independent of X given Z. The conditional randomization test (CRT) was recently proposed as a way to use distributional information about X{\textbar}Z to exactly (non-asymptotically) control Type-I error using any test statistic in any dimensionality without assuming anything about Y{\textbar}(X,Z). This flexibility in principle allows one to derive powerful test statistics from complex prediction algorithms while maintaining statistical validity. Yet the direct use of such advanced test statistics in the CRT is prohibitively computationally expensive, especially with multiple testing, due to the CRT's requirement to recompute the test statistic many times on resampled data. We propose the distilled CRT, a novel approach to using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the CRT while drastically reducing the number of times those algorithms need to be run, thereby taking advantage of their power and the CRT's statistical guarantees without suffering the usual computational expense. In addition to distillation, we propose a number of other tricks like screening and recycling computations to further speed up the CRT without sacrificing its high power and exact validity. Indeed, we show in simulations that all our proposals combined lead to a test that has similar power to the most powerful existing CRT implementations but requires orders of magnitude less computation, making it a practical tool even for large data sets. We demonstrate these benefits on a breast cancer dataset by identifying biomarkers related to cancer stage.},
