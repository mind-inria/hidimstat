Model-X Knockoffs
=================

The Model-X Knockoffs method :footcite:t:`candes2018panning` is a method for variable
selection that controls the false discovery rate (FDR). It is particularly useful in 
high-dimensional settings since its default implementation leverages sparse regression
with the Lasso.
