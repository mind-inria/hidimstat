Notations

.. _glossary_and_notations::

    minus index
    individual features
        The minus index notation is used to denote all features except the one with the 
        given index. For instance, :math:`X_{-j}` denotes all features except the 
        :math:`j^{th}` one.

    Feature groups
        Similar to the minus index notation for individual features, we use the minus 
        index notation to denote the complement of a group of features. For instance, 
        :math:`X_{-G}` denotes all features except the ones in the group :math:`G`.
