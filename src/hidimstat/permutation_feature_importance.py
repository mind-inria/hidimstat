        Permutation Feature Importance algorithm as presented in
        :footcite:t:`breimanRandomForests2001`. For each variable/group of variables,
        the importance is computed as the difference between the loss of the initial
        model and the loss of the model with the variable/group permuted.
        The method was also used in :footcite:t:`mi2021permutation`

        Parameters
        ----------
        estimator : sklearn compatible estimator, optionals
            The estimator to use for the prediction.
        loss : callable, default=root_mean_squared_error
            The loss function to use when comparing the perturbed model to the full
            model.
        method : str, default="predict"
            The method to use for the prediction. This determines the predictions passed
            to the loss function. Supported methods are "predict", "predict_proba" or
            "decision_function".
        n_jobs : int, default=1
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallelization is done over the
            variables or groups of variables.
        n_permutations : int, default=50
            The number of permutations to perform. For each variable/group of variables,
            the mean of the losses over the `n_permutations` is computed.
        random_state : int, default=None
            The random state to use for sampling.
